# Traffic-flow-analysis
The Traffic Flow Analysis System uses YOLOv8 and SORT to detect, track, and count vehicles across three lanes in traffic videos. It outputs a CSV with vehicle IDs, lane, frame, and timestamp, an annotated video with lane overlays and real-time counts, and a JSON summary with final lane-wise and total vehicle statistics.
